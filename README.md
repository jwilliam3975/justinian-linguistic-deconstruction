## Overview

**Justinian Linguistic Deconstruction (JLD)** is a symbolic-linguistic analysis system developed by J. William Gill. It deconstructs words to their earliest recorded symbolic letters (e.g., Proto-Sinaitic, Paleo-Hebrew, Akkadian) and reconstructs their original conceptual meaning as a flowing sentence. JLD bypasses traditional phonetic interpretation and focuses on the symbolic and metaphysical essence of each letter, including dual-aspect (divine and shadow) meanings.

## Key Features

- Ignores vowel systems and Niqqud added in later periods
- Maintains exact letter order in breakdown (no rearranging)
- Produces interpretive sentences based on symbolic flow
- Applies dual-symbolism (light/shadow or divine/contrast)
- Useful for theological study, etymological analysis, and symbolic philosophy
